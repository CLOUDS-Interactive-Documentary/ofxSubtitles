1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Remember the important point about radioactive 
fallout is shielding.

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,607
More shielding between you and the radiation,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,442
more protection.

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,400
There are many things you can improvise
if you have the time.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,018
But how much better to be safe!

6
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:22,088
Develop a shelter project in advance.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
(The loop will restart shortly.)
